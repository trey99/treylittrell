      <p> My favorite colors are <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiZtqmt5I_dAhWQrVMKHbf4D3oQjRx6BAgBEAU&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodfreephotos.com%2Fother-photos%2Fbackgrounds%2Fgreen-grass-background.jpg.php&psig=AOvVaw2aDh1hMvES0SiizhOq9ldv&ust=1535546925271773">green</a>, teal, and blue. I've liked most of these colors for a very long time all except teal I recently decided that teal was a good color because when i saw it it was pleasing to the eye. the case with green and blue is that since i was a child i always liked seeing these colors its probaly cause I see them every day.</p>
